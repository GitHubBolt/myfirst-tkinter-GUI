# myfirst-tkinter-GUI
This is the first part of my first GUI app with Tkinter and Python working with pyserial used to read 8chn of data from Arduino
In this part I managed to create an GUI template using Page Builder and then completing the code to work with pyserial and a InfiniteTimer Class provided by Bill Schumacher on the stackoverflow thread https://stackoverflow.com/a/41450617.
This GUI still need some workout and will have more development of the other buttons in the GUI.
In future I will try to display the graph options with mathplotlib
