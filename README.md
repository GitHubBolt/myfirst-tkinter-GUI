# myfirst-tkinter-GUI

I Started learning on my on python a month ago thanks to all the developers and coders that have share their knowlage over the internet.

This is the first part of my first GUI app with Tkinter and Python working with pyserial used to read 8chn of data from Arduino.

In this part I managed to create an GUI template using Page Builder (http://page.sourceforge.net/) and then completing the code to work with pyserial and a InfiniteTimer Class provided by Bill Schumacher on the stackoverflow thread https://stackoverflow.com/a/41450617.

this is what I have learned so far...

This GUI still need some workout and will have more development of the other buttons in the GUI.

In future I will try to display the graph options with mathplotli
